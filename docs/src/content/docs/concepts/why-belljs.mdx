import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

**Tired of alerts that take up all the screen space and break your users' workflow?** Well, that's why we created **BellJs** not just one but the ultimate alert library that is agnostic to the **js** environment you are using. **BellJs** includes everything you need for a functional alert library, from alert types to promises and themes available to customize this library to the maximum and adjust it to your needs, all of this using an intuitive **API**.

Some of the highlights include:

<CardGrid stagger>
<Card icon="star" title="Lightweight">
**BELLJS** only loads what is necessary. **3kb** minified and gzipped.
</Card>
<Card icon="laptop" title="Responsive and efficient">
It doesn't bother the user, it adapts to your design and works on **any framework**.
</Card>
<Card icon="moon" title="Different themes">
**Easy configuration** and use of new themes.
</Card>
<Card icon="setting" title="New options">
**Customize** everything. Now with event listening.
</Card>
<Card icon="puzzle" title="Good performance">
It doesn't need dependencies, just the **core**.
</Card>
<Card icon="approve-check-circle" title="Mobile design and themes">
It's **responsive**, it works on light and dark themes.
</Card>
<Card icon="rocket" title="Easy to use API">
You just have to **create** and **launch**.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

And knowing all that and more, tell me what are you waiting for to start using it in your project?
