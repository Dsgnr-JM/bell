import Touches from '../../../components/TouchesPlay.astro'

The second parameter of **Bell** is a `String` and refers to the type of alert, depending on which one you choose the alert will become different, some of the types are:

- **`info`**: Alerts to display information.
- **`error`**: Alerts to report an error.
- **`success`**: Alerts to show that a goal was achieved.
- **`warning`**: Alerts to show that something happened, not necessarily a critical error.
- **`promise`**: Alerts to indicate that something is loading.

You can use any of these in your alerts, here is an example:

```js
new Bell({
title: "A serious error occurred",
},"error").launch()
```

<Touches slug="en-choosing-the-type-of-alert"/>

This will display an alert with the type of error.

This property is required.
