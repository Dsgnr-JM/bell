Removing alerts is an important topic because if we want to have full control over alerts we will need to understand this option.

Instances of `Bell` have a public method called `dimiss` that is responsible for removing the alert from the screen, depending on the `animate` property the alert will have or not an animation when it appears.

## Removal events

In addition to the `dimiss` method there are properties in the third parameter of `Bell` that serve as alert removal events, the property I am referring to is `removeOn` that can have the values ​​`button` or `click`. Both remove the alert but in a different way:

- **`button`**: Creates a button to remove the alert.
- **`click`**: Removes the alert when a click is made.

Let's see an example of how to use it with a button:

```js
new Bell({
description: "Removing the alert with a button"
},"info",{
removeOn:"button",
screenTime: "10000"
}).launch()
```
