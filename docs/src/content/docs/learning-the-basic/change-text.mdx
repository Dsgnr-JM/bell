description: Information about the first parameters of BellJs which are the title and subtitle.

import Touches from '../../../components/TouchesPlay.astro'

Remember that **BellJs** accepts three parameters, well the first of them is an `Object` with the properties `title` and `description`.

- **`title`**: This parameter configures the text of the alert title.
- **`description`**: This parameter configures the text of the alert paragraph.

You can use both or just one, let's see an example:

### Only the title

To make an alert with only the title you must create an instance of `Bell` and pass as the first parameter an object with only the title.

```js
new Bell({
title: "Only with title"
}).launch()
```
This will display an alert with only the title on the screen.

<Touches slug="en-change-text"/>

### Only the description

In this case, instead of sending the title, we will send only the description, this in the first object.

```js
new Bell({
description: "Only with description"
}).launch()
```

<Touches slug="en-change-text-description"/>

Always remember to send at least one of the properties.
