**BellJs** now supports promises, this means that you can show a loading layout while loading a request for a promise.

To use promises in **Bell** you just have to use the promises method of that instance. Let's see an example:

The first thing we do is create a *promise* in JavaScript and the states that the promise will have are: `pending`, `success` and `error`.

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve,reject) =>{
setTimeout(()=>{
resolve()
},10000)
})
const state = {
pending:"Pending promise",
success:"Resolved promise",
error:"Bad promise"
}
```

Then we create an instance of `Bell`, we pass it a `title` that will serve as a placeholder and the `promise` type.

```js
const bell = new Bell({
title: "Placeholder"
},"promise")
```

Finally we use the `promise` method and we pass it the states and the promise as parameters:

```js
bell.promise(promise, state)
```
<Touches slug="en-promises" isPromise="true"/>

And that's it, you can now use promises in `BellJs` with `fetch` or others.
