title: Customizing Bell
description: The third parameter is the most customizable since it is a set of instructions for bell.

import Touches from '../../../components/TouchesPlay.astro'

The third parameter is an `Object` with different types of properties from the time at which the alert will be displayed on the screen, to customizable `HTML`.

## Changing animations and time

Animations and time are crucial stages in UX/UI and **BellJs** knows this, that's why we created the `screenTime`, `animate`, `expand`, `timeline`, `transitionDuration` and `typeAnimation` properties, let's see each one of them.

### Using animations

To change the animations of `Bell` it is as easy as changing the `typeAnimation` property in the third parameter, there are different options in this case we will use the more animated `bound-2` that animates a bounce in the alert.

```js
new Bell({
title: "Bounce Alert"
},"info",{
typeAnimation: "bound-2"
}).launch()
```
<Touches slug="en-customized-bell-anim"/>

This generates the animation in the alert, of course if they are not deactivated by the `animate` parameter.

### Modifying the screen time

To change the screen time of the alerts you only have to modify the `screenTime` property, it receives a `Number` value that defaults to 3000, which is equal to 3 seconds.

```js
new Bell({
title: "Alert with 5 seconds on screen"
},"info",{
screenTime: 5000
}).launch()
```

<Touches slug="en-customized-bell-time"/>

With this you can now modify the screen time that your alerts have, be careful the `transitionDuration` that you use will be added to the `screenTime` this means:

```js
new Bell({
title: "Alert with 5 seconds on screen"
},"info",{
screenTime: 5000,
transitionDuration: 400
}).launch()

// Screen time will be equal to 5400
```

<Touches slug="en-customized-bell-time-2"/>

Finally we add a timeline to see how much time the alert has left before disappearing:

```js
new Bell({
title: "Alert with 5 seconds on screen"
},"info",{
timeline:true,
screenTime: 5000,
transitionDuration: 400
}).launch()
```
<Touches slug="en-customized-bell-time-3"/>

### Expand mode or not?

By default the `expand` mode is disabled in `Bell`, although it can be enabled by changing this property to `true`:

```js
new Bell({
title: "With expand"
},"info",{
expand: true
}).launch()
```

<Touches slug="en-customized-expand"/>

You can use this if you want an effect similar to the **Toastify** library.

## Different positions.

With **BellJs** you can use different positions at the same time without generating errors. At the moment `Bell` has 6 different positions

- `bottom-right`: Shows an alert below and to the right
- `bottom-left`: Shows an alert below and to the right
- `bottom-center`: Shows an alert below and to the center
- `top-right`: Shows an alert above and to the right
- `top-left`: Shows an alert above and to the right
- `top-center`: Shows an alert above and to the center

The code would be the following:

```js
new Bell({
title: "Bottom right"
},"info",{
position: "bottom-right"
}).launch()

new Bell({
title: "Top left"
},"info",{
position: "top-left"
}).launch()
```

<Touches slug="en-customized-position"/>
<Touches slug="en-customized-position-2"/>

If you want to modify the positions a little more you can use `distance` that modifies the `x` or `y` axis. Depending on whether you are using the `right`, `left`, `top` or `bottom` positions. Let's see a clear example:
```js
new Bell({
title: "Bottom right"
},"info",{
position: "bottom-right",
distance: {
x: 0,
y: 0
}
}).launch()
```

<Touches slug="en-customized-position-3"/>

With this the alert will be displayed at the bottom right, with `0` pixels of distance from the screen.
